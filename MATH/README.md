- **MEDPRIME.cpp** – Prime factorization approach to compute median exponents and product of primes.
- **MOCKN.cpp** – Uses Mo’s algorithm with combinatorics to answer range queries.
- **TREE.cpp** – Tree query processing with DFS + Mo’s algorithm, supports subtree queries by color.
- **VALU.cpp** – Range query processing (Mo’s algorithm) with frequency-based sum updates.

## Techniques Used
- Modular arithmetic (`PowerMod`, modular inverses)  
- Factorization and median exponent calculation  
- Mo’s algorithm for offline query optimization
